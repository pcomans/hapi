"""Apply deterministic normalization + LLM-reviewer corrections to reconciled.jsonl.

Run AFTER merge.py. Mirrors Dodson-Hilton's pattern — idempotent re-runs,
append-only LLM-APPLIED OVERRIDES section in merge-disagreements.txt,
every override recorded with rationale.

Two passes:

1. **Deterministic transliteration normalization** (`_normalise_transliteration`).
   The three extraction agents rendered the Egyptological ayin and aleph
   characters inconsistently — the PDF's text layer hands out `ˁ` (U+02C1)
   / `ɛ` (U+025B) / `ɜ` (U+025C) as fallbacks, but the canonical IFAO /
   pharaoh.se / Beckerath convention is `ꜥ` (U+A725) and `ꜣ` (U+A723).
   Majority-vote on majority-fallback selected the wrong codepoints; a
   deterministic post-pass restores the canonical form across every
   string-valued field recursively. Parallels Kitchen's
   `concurrent_with_kings` recomputation: "interval overlap is a pure
   function of already-extracted fields, don't trust the LLMs on it."

2. **LLM-reviewer spot corrections** — populated after the
   egyptologist-reviewer subagent pass (empty list until then). Baud-specific
   risks: dropped hedges (Baud is especially hedge-heavy; OK prosopography
   is sparsely attested), scholarly judgment promoted to hard claim,
   missing `service_personnel: true` for asterisk-marked headwords.

Run:
    cd pipeline && uv run python pipeline/authority/sources/baud-1999-ok-royal-family/fix_rows.py

Idempotent: re-running replaces (not duplicates) the LLM-APPLIED OVERRIDES
section in merge-disagreements.txt. `merge-disagreements.txt` reflects the
PRE-normalization per-agent diff — it is the merge's audit trail of how
the three LLMs disagreed, and should not be regenerated post-normalization.
