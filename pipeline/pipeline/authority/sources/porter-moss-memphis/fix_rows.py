"""Apply post-merge corrections to reconciled.jsonl.

Runs AFTER merge.py. Carries two classes of fix:

1. **Source-wide deterministic OCR substitutions** that should ideally happen
   pre-extraction at the `postprocess.py` layer but were not present when the
   chunk's raw text-layer was read. Currently: PM's Reisner-Roman-numeral
   tokens `G II` and `G III` render in the Griffith Institute text layer as
   Arabic `G 11` and `G 111` (the same OCR engine renders `G I` correctly,
   confirmed by the egyptologist-reviewer pass — chunk 1 PM III.1 review,
   2026-05-15). These appear in `notes_from_pm` cells where the source-faithful
   form is the Roman. Deterministic substring fix, longest-match first.

2. **Per-chunk reviewer-cited corrections** (`<CHUNK>_CORRECTIONS` dicts) for
   row-specific egyptologist findings beyond the source-wide substring rules.
   Currently empty for chunk 1 (clean review pass, 0 P1, 1 P2 already handled
   by the substring rule, 2 P3 nits).

Invocation:
    cd pipeline && uv run python pipeline/authority/sources/porter-moss-memphis/fix_rows.py

Idempotent: re-running on already-fixed reconciled.jsonl is a no-op (each
substitution's right-hand side does not contain the left-hand side).
