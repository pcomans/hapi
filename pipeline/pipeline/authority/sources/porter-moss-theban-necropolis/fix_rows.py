"""Apply LLM-reviewer-identified corrections to reconciled.jsonl.

Run AFTER merge.py. Mirrors Kitchen / Baud / Dodson-Hilton patterns —
idempotent re-runs, append-only LLM-APPLIED OVERRIDES section in
merge-disagreements.txt, every override recorded with rationale.

For chunk 1 (KV1–KV10): the field-rule-based prompt rewrite (post code-
reviewer feedback on PR #66) means agents now extract `source_citation.page`
from the chunk text running header, capture the complete `notes_from_pm`
clause across two-line headword wraps, and populate `occupant_alt_names`
from headword classical-alias parentheticals. The egyptologist-reviewer's
chunk-1 findings are therefore handled at extraction time; CHUNK1_CORRECTIONS
is empty pending any further reviewer-identified fixes.

Run:
    cd pipeline && uv run python pipeline/authority/sources/porter-moss-theban-necropolis/fix_rows.py

Idempotent: re-running replaces (not duplicates) the LLM-APPLIED OVERRIDES
section in merge-disagreements.txt.

# Chunk-2 (KV11–KV20) corrections. The prompt was rewritten post-PR-#68
# code-review (original prompt was flagged as an answer-table — rule 1/7
# regression) and the three agents were re-run under the field-rule prompt.
# Four residual corrections remain after the re-merge:
#
# 1. KV12 — `occupant_role`: prompt rule 1 says role="Unknown" when
#    occupant_name is null (UNINSCRIBED tombs), but all three agents
#    still emit null (transcribing the empty cell alongside empty name).
# 2. KV13 — `notes_from_pm`: agents captured PM's full headword suffix
#    `"Chancellor. Temp. Merneptaḥ-Siptaḥ"`. The `Chancellor` title is
#    already encoded via `occupant_role="Official"` per prompt rule 2
#    — duplicating it in notes violates single-source-of-truth. Strip
#    the prefix and normalise `ḥ` → `h` to match chunk-1's convention
#    (Merneptah without underdot).
# 3. KV18 — `notes_from_pm`: agents captured `"(formerly XI)"` including
#    the parentheses. Chunk 1's KV4 note for the same pattern is
#    `"formerly XII"` without parens. Strip parens for consistency.
# 4. KV19 — `occupant_name`: the `MENTUHIRKHOPSHEF` glyph in PM's text
#    layer has no underdot-H marker (it's `UH`, not the `I:I` form seen
#    elsewhere), but two of three agents over-normalised to `Mentuḥir...`.
#    Align with chunk-1's no-underdot convention (Hatshepsut, Merneptah).
#    Egyptologist-reviewer on PR #68 confirmed PM prints no underdot here.

#
# 1. KV34 — `notes_from_pm`: PM p.551 prints `34. [1st ed. 24] TUTHMOSIS

# (PR #140 / #132) now handles both at chunk-text level: KV36's

#   TT131 — all 3 agents mis-decoded OCR `6z` as `62` (TT62) rather than `61`

#     the same official; TT62 (Overseer of Cabinet, Temp. Tuthmosis III (?)) is

#     back-ref TT61 because TT61 already carries `shared_with_tombs: ["TT131"]`
#     from an earlier chunk. Fix: `shared_with_tombs: ["TT61"]` and
#     `notes_from_pm: "(See tomb 61.) ..."` (replacing both the cross-ref value
#     and the parenthetical text). The `z`→`1` OCR misread is a known hazard for
#     this scan's numeral rendering (compare `z`→`2` majority class).
#   TT133 — restore `Ḥunuro` underdot-ḥ (B+C majority stripped it; source OCR
#     `l:lunuro` = `Ḥunuro`; verbatim-preserve policy for notes_from_pm).
#   TT135 — `Wab-priest` → `wʿab-priest` (ayin before a, lowercase per PM
#     body-prose convention; same class as TT113/TT114 ayin-before-a).
#   TT136 — occupant_role: None → "Unknown" (sentinel-null coercion by merge.py;
#     same precedent as TT58/TT70/TT91; all 3 agents correctly emitted
#     occupant_role="Unknown" but the SENTINEL_NULL_STRINGS pass coerced it).
#   TT138 — `Wife, Nesha.` → `Wife, Neshaʿ.` (ayin restoration; source OCR
#     `Nesha(` = `Neshaʿ`; A+B emitted ayin, C dropped it; C won tie-break
#     on other axes, so ayin must be restored here).
#   TT139 — `Wab-priest` → `wʿab-priest` (same ayin-before-a class as TT135).
#   TT140 — `Kefia` → `Ḥefia` in notes_from_pm (OCR `~EFIA` / `l):.efia`
#     confirms underdot-Ḥ; `Hefia` in occupant_alt_names is ḥ-stripped per
#     TT57/TT120 matchable-name precedent and resolves correctly via tie-break
#     override; verbatim-preserve notes_from_pm restores `Ḥefia` with underdot).

# Chunk-27 (TT181–TT190, Khôkha + ʿAsâsîf). Five PDF-verified corrections
# applied post-merge, all verbatim-preserve restorations against PM I.1:
#
# 1. TT181 — `occupant_name`: PM p.286 headword prints `NEBAMŪN` with
#    capital macron-Ū. Same pypdf capital-macron-drop OCR class as TT65
#    `NEBAMŪN` (chunk-15) and TT17 `NEBAMŪN` (chunk-10). All 3 agents
#    emitted `Nebamun`; restore macron-Ū.
# 2. TT181 — `notes_from_pm`: tie-break pinned agent A's form which carries
#    two errors the PDF resolves: (a) `Nebamon` → `Nebamūn` (macron +
#    correct `un` ending — PM p.286 prints `NEBAMŪN` headword); (b)
#    `Senennoter` → `Senennūter` (macron-Ū — PM p.286 prints `Senennūter`
#    with macron-Ū; the `no`→`ū` is a clear OCR misread of the macron
#    over the `ū`).
# 3. TT187 — `notes_from_pm`: tie-break pinned agent A's `Wab-priest`
#    (PM-faithful for the role-token but capitalized). PM p.293 prints
#    `wʿab-priest of Amūn. Dyn. XIX.` (OCR text-layer renders the printed
#    `wʿab-priest` as `warb-priest`). Three restorations: (a) `Wab-priest`
#    → `wʿab-priest` (insert U+02BF ayin + lowercase sentence-initial per
#    chunk-22 TT113 ayin-before-a precedent); (b) `Amun` → `Amūn`
#    (macron-Ū per chunk-12-onward verbatim-preserve); (c) `<Ashakhet`
#    → `ʿAshakhet` (ayin whitelist).
# 4. TT189 — `notes_from_pm`: tie-break pinned agent A's `Neteḥab` (closest
#    to PM-faithful). PM p.295 prints `Netemḥab` (underdot-H, with `m`).
#    Restore the missing `m` + add macron-Ū to `Amūn` ×2 per the
#    verbatim-preserve policy (same chunk-12-onward macron-retain class).
# 5. TT190 — `notes_from_pm`: tie-break pinned agent C's `Meramuniotes` and
#    `Amen-Re`. PM p.297 prints `Meramūniotes` (macron-Ū) and `Amen-rēʿ`
#    (macron-ē + ayin). Restore both diacritics.

# === Chunk 30 — TT211-TT220 (Deir el-Medina) =================================
#
# Tie-break-overrides.json resolved 6 substantive 1/1/1 splits:
#   TT211|notes_from_pm — pin C (commas, Wa'be(t) bracket)
#   TT213|notes_from_pm — pin C (Bald not Baldi, no L.D. bleed)
#   TT215|notes_from_pm — pin C (correct order, tomb 335)
#   TT217|notes_from_pm — pin B (commas, no title expansion)
#   TT217|source_citation — pin 315 (source-confirmed headword page)
#   TT218|notes_from_pm — pin A (Hr-mnw abbreviation, ayins)
#
# Post-merge CHUNK30_CORRECTIONS apply:
#
#   1. TT211 source_citation.page: 308 → 307 (2/1 majority wrong; headword
#      `211. PANEB` appears at source line 25 under PRINTED PAGE 307).
#   2. TT211 notes_from_pm: `Wa'be(t)` → `Waʿbe(t)` — straight apostrophe `'`
#      restored to proper ayin U+02BF. Source `Wa<be(t)` where `<` = ayin ʿ
#      (same OCR-ayin rendering class as TT210 `Nefertkhaʿ` in CHUNK29).
#   3. TT214 notes_from_pm: `Amun` → `Amūn` — macron-Ū per chunk-12-onward
#      verbatim-preserve policy (PM body prose prints `Amūn` throughout).
#   4. TT215 source_citation.page: 312 → 311 (2/1 majority wrong; headword
#      `215. AMENEMOPET` appears at source line 332 under PRINTED PAGE 311).
#   5. TT215 shared_with_tombs: [] → ["TT265"] — 2/1 majority (B+C) wrong;
#      source line 332-333 explicitly states `(Burial Chamber is tomb 265.)`.
#      Same shared-burial-chamber precedent as TT215/TT265 bidirectional pair.
#   6. TT215 notes_from_pm: restore underdot-Ḥ on `Ḥatḥor` and `Ḥunuro` +
#      append `(L. D. Text, No. 100.)` — source line 395 `(L. D. Text, No. Ioo.)`
#      appears on TT216's locator line; TT215's locator also has a cite but
#      the TT215 agents' OCR extracted it from the Amenemopet body-cite line 344.
#      Actually the L.D. cite for TT215 appears in Agent A's form only and was
#      dropped by the tie-break — restoring here. PM `l:Iati}.or` = `Ḥatḥor`
#      (underdot-Ḥ); `I:Iunuro` = `Ḥunuro` (underdot-Ḥ); both verbatim-preserve.
#   7. TT216 source_citation.page: 313 → 312 (unanimous-wrong; headword
#      `216. NEFERḤOTEP` appears at source line 391 under PRINTED PAGE 312).
#   8. TT216 notes_from_pm: append `(L. D. Text, No. 100.)` — source line 395
#      `Deir el-Medina. (L. D. Text, No. Ioo.)` is a locator-line cite for TT216.
#      All 3 agents omitted it (2/1 majority pinned no-cite form). Per TT212
#      locator-line-cite precedent (same cite format, same Deir el-Medina area
#      line), the L.D. text citation belongs in notes_from_pm.
#   9. TT217 notes_from_pm: `Nefertkha` → `Nefertkhaʿ` — ayin restore; PM
#      source `Nefertkha<` where `<` = ayin ʿ (same OCR-ayin class as TT210
#      `Nefertkhaʿ` in CHUNK29, TT217 is Ipuy, son of Piay + Nefertkhaʿ).
#  10. TT218 source_citation.page: 318 → 317 (unanimous-wrong; headword
#      `218. AMENNAKHT` at source line 649 under PRINTED PAGE 317).
#  11. TT218 notes_from_pm: (a) colons → commas, (b) remove Co-occupants
#      clause (spurious agent annotation not in PM headword), (c) parenthetical
#      → comma form for parent title, (d) `Hetepti` → `Ḥetepti` (underdot-Ḥ;
#      source `I;Ietepti`), (e) `Amon` → `Amūn` (macron-Ū).
#  12. TT219 source_citation.page: 321 → 320 (unanimous-wrong; headword
#      `219. NEBENMACET` at source line 847 under PRINTED PAGE 320).
#  13. TT219 occupant_name: `Nebenmaet` → `Nebenmaʿet` — ayin restore;
#      PM headword `NEBENMA<ET` where `<` = ayin ʿ (2/1 majority stripped it).
#  14. TT220 occupant_name: `Khaemteri` → `Khaʿemteri` — ayin restore;
#      PM headword `KHA<EMTERI` where `<` = ayin ʿ (2/1 majority stripped it).

# === Audit-fix migration (issue: occupant_alt_names misuse) ==================
#
# Pre-PR-A audit (2026-05-02) found two distinct schema misuses in PM rows:
#
# Shape A — tomb nicknames stuffed in `occupant_alt_names` (which is meant
# for alternate name forms of the SAME PERSON, e.g. throne-name vs personal-
# name). Affected rows (4): KV9, KV11, KV17, KV23. The strings are aliases
# of the TOMB (Belzoni's tomb, Bruce's tomb, local Arabic surveyor names),
# not of its occupant.
#
# Shape B — joint occupants compounded into a single `occupant_name` string
# with `" and "` / `", and "` (KV46 Yuia+Thuiu, SWV Three Princesses Menhet
# +Merti+Menwi). The compound string is unjoinable against any king/person
# authority and the per-occupant role is lost in the aggregate "Royal
# Family" label.
#
# Fix:
#   - Add `tomb_aliases: list[str]` field for tomb nicknames.
#   - Add `co_occupants: list[{name, role, alt_names}]` field for additional
#     people buried in the same tomb. Headword stays as the row-level
#     `occupant_name` / `occupant_role` / `occupant_alt_names` triplet.
#   - Migrate existing rows via SCHEMA_FIELD_DEFAULTS (adds the missing
#     fields with `[]` defaults) + AUDIT_FIX_CORRECTIONS (moves values from
#     `occupant_alt_names`/`occupant_name` to the correct fields).
#
# `occupant_alt_names` retains its honest meaning post-fix: ONLY alternate
# readings of the SAME person's name (prenomens like the chunk-7 DAN-Antef
# rows; transliteration variants; throne-name vs birth-name pairs).
# `valley` → `theban_area` field rename (PR #170, 2026-05-02). The rename
# was a pure key change applied to `reconciled.jsonl` directly + every
# prompt + every test, but the per-chunk agent JSONLs were NOT updated
# (they remain the stable record of each round of agent extraction).
# Re-running `merge.py` therefore regenerates rows with the OLD `valley`
# key — restoring the old field name. This migration runs in `main()`
# before `SPOT_CORRECTIONS` to rename the key on every row that still
# carries it. Idempotent: a row that already has `theban_area` is
# untouched. Per CLAUDE.md rule 3 (deterministic-enforcement-over-
# convention), the rename's "convention" of "always edit reconciled.jsonl
# directly when renaming a key" needs a code-level enforcement so re-
# merge doesn't silently regress.

# Sub-site (theban_area) value migration to PM-faithful canonical forms (issues

# printed diacritics, consistent with how `Sh. ʿAbd el-Qurna` / `ʿAsâsîf` /
# `Qurnet Muraʿi` already preserve PM's diacritics. The agent prompts and the
# per-chunk agent JSONLs landed BEFORE this decision used the project-stripped
# forms (`Dra' Abu el-Naga` / `Khokha` / `Deir el-Bahari`). Re-running merge.py
# regenerates rows with the OLD stripped values from the stable agent JSONLs;

#    Only agent B captured the ayin. Restore ayin per verbatim-preserve

# === Chunk-39 (TT301–TT310, Draʿ Abû el-Nagaʿ + Deir el-Baḥri + Sh. ʿAbd el-Qurna) =====
# First chunk to introduce `Deir el-Baḥri` as a primary `theban_area` value
# (TT308 Kemsit in the Temple of Mentuḥotp; TT310 anonymous Chancellor).
# The TT280 precedent used `Deir el-Baḥri` only as a `location_sub_area`
# qualifier because TT280's grid (D-3) pointed to Draʿ Abû el-Nagaʿ proper.
# TT308/TT310 are structurally different: PM I.1 p.385-386 lists them under
# the Deir el-Baḥri grid (Map III, C-4) and explicitly names the site in the
# headword. `Deir el-Baḥri` is admitted as a valid `theban_area` value.
#
# Corrections in this chunk:
# 1. TT301 occupant_name: `Khori` → `Hori` (source `I;IORI` where `I;I`=Ḥ;
#    strip-ḥ rule for matchable `occupant_name` field: Ḥori → `Hori`).
# 2. TT302 occupant_name: `Paraemhab` → `Paraʿemhab` (source `PARA<EMI;IAB`
#    where `<`=ayin, `I;I`=Ḥ; strip-ḥ retains ayin: `Paraʿemhab`).
# 3. TT302 notes_from_pm: `Userhat` → `Userḥat` (underdot-ḥ restore in
#    verbatim-preserve notes field; `Userl}~t` OCR → `Userḥat`).
# 4. TT303 occupant_role: `High Priest` → `Official` (Third prophet ≠ First
#    prophet; see CHUNK39_CORRECTIONS note 4 below; not a DERIVER_OVERRIDE
#    as the majority vote was factually wrong on the role mapping).
# 5. TT305 notes_from_pm: restore ayin in `Wab-priest` → `Wʿab-priest`
#    (source `warb-priest` = OCR for wʿab-priest where `<`=ayin rendered as `r`).
# 6. TT305 co_occupants: name `Tamelkhit` → `Tamelhit` (strip-ḥ: source
#    `Tamel;lit` = `Tamelḥit`; strip-ḥ applied → `Tamelhit`).
# 7. TT307 notes_from_pm: parenthesise `(Unfinished.)` per PM source
#    (source line 275: `(Unfinished.)` with parentheses).
# 8. TT308 notes_from_pm: add temple location qualifier and restore diacritics
#    (source line 289: `Deir el-Baḥri, in the Temple of Mentuḥotp.` +
#    ayin on Nebḥepetreʿ + ḥ-underdot on Mentuḥotp and Ḥatḥor).

#     C=Hatiay, no bib. Tie-break pinned C-shape with Ḥatiay restored (source line 9
#     `I:Iatiay` where `I:I`=Ḥ). No L.D.Text marker for TT331; that marker belongs to TT335
#     (source line 188). CHUNK42_CORRECTIONS restores Hatiay→Ḥatiay diacritic.
#     EGYPTOLOGIST REVIEW REQUIRED: confirm Ḥatiay from PM I.1 p.399.
#   TT332|source_citation — majority A+B=400; source line 34 is inside PHYSICAL PAGE 417
#     (PRINTED PAGE 399) block (lines 1-52), before page break at line 53. Correct=399.
#   TT333|source_citation — 3-way tie 400/401/399; tie-break → 399 (source line 48 in
#     PRINTED PAGE 399 block). Correct. No further correction needed.
#   TT335|source_citation — majority A+B=402; source line 186 is inside PHYSICAL PAGE 419
#     (PRINTED PAGE 401) block (lines 152-206), before page break to 402 at line 207.
#     Correct=401.
#   TT335|co_occupants — majority A+B=[{role:Official, no name}]; C=[]. TT335 is Nekhtamun
#     solo; no co_occupant. The empty-name entry is a spurious extraction artifact.
#     Correct=[] (C is right).
#   TT339|source_citation — unanimous A+B+C=407; source line 460 is inside PHYSICAL PAGE 424
#     (PRINTED PAGE 406) block (lines 414-468), before page break to 407 at line 469.
#     Correct=406.
#   TT339|co_occupants — majority A+B=[{role:Official, no name}]; C=[{name:Peshedu,...}].
#     This IS joint burial (Huy + Peshedu); co_occupant name Peshedu must be present.
#     Restore name from C's extraction. is_joint_burial already True via majority.
#   TT340|attribution_certainty — majority A+B=probable; C=attested. `perhaps` in notes
#     applies to secondary ownership of tomb 354 (`perhaps also owner of tomb 354`), NOT
#     to Amenemḥet's primary occupancy. DERIVER_OVERRIDE → attested.

# CHUNK42_CORRECTIONS:
# 1. TT331 notes_from_pm: restore Ḥatiay diacritic (tie-break value pinned `Hatiay`
#    from C; source `I:Iatiay` where `I:I`=Ḥ OCR cluster → `Ḥatiay`).
#    EGYPTOLOGIST REVIEW REQUIRED: confirm Ḥatiay from PM I.1 p.399.
# 2. TT332 source_citation.page: majority-wrong 400 → 399.
# 3. TT335 source_citation.page: majority-wrong 402 → 401.
# 4. TT335 co_occupants: remove spurious empty-name entry → [].
# 5. TT339 source_citation.page: unanimous-wrong 407 → 406.
# 6. TT339 co_occupants: restore Peshedu name stripped by majority vote.

# 1. TT371, TT375, TT376, TT377, TT378, TT379 — `occupant_role`: sentinel-
#    null normalisation in merge.py collapses all three agents' `"Unknown"`
#    to null (because "unknown" is in SENTINEL_NULL_STRINGS). Restore per
#    the null-name/null-role pairing invariant established at KV12 (chunk-2),
#    QV36/40/73/75 (chunk-8), TT58 (chunk-14), TT225–TT230 (chunk-26), etc.
#
# 2. TT374 — `notes_from_pm`: agent C correctly included PM's cross-reference
#    sentence `"For position, see p. 292."` (chunk-46 source text line 92,
#    physical PDF p.452 / printed p.434). Agents A+B majority dropped it.
#    Per the verbatim-preserve policy for notes_from_pm and the established
#    precedent of TT304 (`"For position, see p. 356."`) and TT365
#    (`"For position, see p. ..."`) both preserved in reconciled.jsonl,
#    the dropped cross-reference must be restored.

    """Per-row schema-audit migrations for issue #182. Idempotent.

    Runs the regex-based derivers first, then applies `DERIVER_OVERRIDES`

    secondary-clause hedge that PM does not apply to the primary occupant
    attribution. The override pass is logged distinctly from the deriver
    pass so the audit trail makes the override-vs-derivation distinction
    explicit.

    Design note (per code-reviewer P2-3 on PR #196): the deriver pass
    runs unconditionally on every row, including those in
    `DERIVER_OVERRIDES`. We could short-circuit (skip the regex when an
    override exists) and avoid the temporary "deriver wrote X / override
    wrote Y" two-line log entry per override row. Trade-off chosen: keep
    the deriver visible in the log so adding a new override is auditable
    against what the regex would have produced — the future maintainer
    inspecting `merge-disagreements.txt` sees the exact regex output the
    override is countermanding. The on-disk file is byte-stable across
    runs (the deriver result is deterministic, the override is
    deterministic, both fire the same way every run), so idempotence is
    preserved. If `DERIVER_OVERRIDES` grows past ~10 entries this
