"""Apply LLM-reviewer-identified corrections to reconciled.jsonl.

Run AFTER merge.py. Mirrors Kitchen / Baud / Dodson-Hilton patterns —
idempotent re-runs, append-only LLM-APPLIED OVERRIDES section in
merge-disagreements.txt, every override recorded with rationale.

For chunk 1 (KV1–KV10): the field-rule-based prompt rewrite (post code-
reviewer feedback on PR #66) means agents now extract `source_citation.page`
from the chunk text running header, capture the complete `notes_from_pm`
clause across two-line headword wraps, and populate `occupant_alt_names`
from headword classical-alias parentheticals. The egyptologist-reviewer's
chunk-1 findings are therefore handled at extraction time; CHUNK1_CORRECTIONS
is empty pending any further reviewer-identified fixes.

Run:
    cd pipeline && uv run python pipeline/authority/sources/porter-moss-theban-necropolis/fix_rows.py

Idempotent: re-running replaces (not duplicates) the LLM-APPLIED OVERRIDES
section in merge-disagreements.txt.

# Chunk-2 (KV11–KV20) corrections. The prompt was rewritten post-PR-#68
# code-review (original prompt was flagged as an answer-table — rule 1/7
# regression) and the three agents were re-run under the field-rule prompt.
# Four residual corrections remain after the re-merge:
#
# 1. KV12 — `occupant_role`: prompt rule 1 says role="Unknown" when
#    occupant_name is null (UNINSCRIBED tombs), but all three agents
#    still emit null (transcribing the empty cell alongside empty name).
# 2. KV13 — `notes_from_pm`: agents captured PM's full headword suffix
#    `"Chancellor. Temp. Merneptaḥ-Siptaḥ"`. The `Chancellor` title is
#    already encoded via `occupant_role="Official"` per prompt rule 2
#    — duplicating it in notes violates single-source-of-truth. Strip
#    the prefix and normalise `ḥ` → `h` to match chunk-1's convention
#    (Merneptah without underdot).
# 3. KV18 — `notes_from_pm`: agents captured `"(formerly XI)"` including
#    the parentheses. Chunk 1's KV4 note for the same pattern is
#    `"formerly XII"` without parens. Strip parens for consistency.
# 4. KV19 — `occupant_name`: the `MENTUHIRKHOPSHEF` glyph in PM's text
#    layer has no underdot-H marker (it's `UH`, not the `I:I` form seen
#    elsewhere), but two of three agents over-normalised to `Mentuḥir...`.
#    Align with chunk-1's no-underdot convention (Hatshepsut, Merneptah).
#    Egyptologist-reviewer on PR #68 confirmed PM prints no underdot here.
