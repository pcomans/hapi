# Extraction prompt — Porter & Moss Vol I.1 (Theban Necropolis), Chunk 27

> **Nineteenth chunk drawn from PM I.1 (Private Tombs); extending the TT181–TT190 range past chunk-26's TT171–TT180 coverage.** Chunks 9 (TT1–TT10), 10 (TT11–TT20), 11 (TT21–TT30), 12 (TT31–TT40), 13 (TT41–TT50), 14 (TT51–TT60), 15 (TT61–TT70), 16 (TT71–TT80), 17 (TT81–TT90), 18 (TT91–TT100), 19 (TT101–TT110), 20 (TT111–TT120), 21 (TT121–TT130), 22 (TT131–TT140), 23 (TT141–TT150), 24 (TT151–TT160), 25 (TT161–TT170), and 26 (TT171–TT180) established the PM-I.1 conventions including heterogeneous sub-sites, usurpation patterns, cross-valley references, Vizier-precedence, capital-macron restoration, the d-emphatic d-bar (`Ḏ` U+1E0E) convention for the Thoth/Djehuty name family, anonymous-occupant headwords, hierarchical mother/son co-occupancy, bracketed-fragment headwords, and per-page PDF verification of body-prose ḥ-underdot diacritics (per PR #208 + tracking issue #209: do NOT pre-derive ḥ-underdot for body-prose names from cross-volume / cross-page precedent — read the printed page). This prompt is **self-contained** — the agent does NOT need to read prior chunks' prompts; every field rule, schema invariant, and noise pattern is documented here in full. (Per chunk-10 code-reviewer P1 #3: cross-prompt references are fragility risk; each subagent reads exactly one prompt.)

You are one of three independent extraction subagents. Read the text-layer chunk file at `pipeline/pipeline/authority/sources/porter-moss-theban-necropolis/raw/chunk-27-tt181-tt190.txt` and produce a JSONL file with one structured row per numbered tomb in PM I.1 § I "Numbered Tombs" within the **TT181–TT190** range. The other two agents see the same prompt and the same chunk; their outputs are majority-voted by `merge.py`.

**Prompt discipline (per CLAUDE.md rules 1 and 7):** this prompt gives field-extraction RULES and normalisation conventions — it does NOT hand you per-tomb answers. Every field value must trace to something in the chunk file. The only things the prompt may validly hint: structural facts about the section (page range, tomb-id range), text-layer noise signatures, vocabulary constraints, and explicit examples drawn from PRIOR landed chunks (chunks 1–26) for analogy. The full PM-I.1 rule set (heterogeneous sub-sites, the d-emphatic d-bar `Ḏ` convention, capital-macron drop, anonymous-occupant headwords, Vizier-precedence, bracketed-name-fragment headwords, etc.) is documented here as RULES — whether or not all of them happen to apply to this chunk's rows.

- Section: **I. Numbered Tombs**, TT181–TT190 range.
- PM I.1 offset: **printed = physical − 18** (distinct from PM I.2's +458 used in chunks 1–8).
- The chunk file starts at physical p.304 (printed p.286, capturing the **TT181 headword** which opens after TT180 closure on the same page) and extends through physical p.316 (printed p.298) so you can see the **TT191 headword** at the tail as a boundary marker — **do NOT extract any TT191+ rows**. Stop at the end of TT190's headword block. The chunk is 13 physical pages; body prose is out of scope regardless of length — filter on column-zero headword shape.
- Per-page markers `===== PHYSICAL PAGE N (PRINTED PAGE M) =====` precede each page's text-layer dump. Use `M` (the printed number) for `source_citation.page`.
- Text layer: extracted by `pypdf` from the Griffith Institute's distributed PDF, then post-processed by `postprocess.py`.

One JSON object per line. Sort rows by numeric `tomb_id` ascending (TT181 first, TT190 last). Use `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)` for deterministic output.

## Schema (per row — full schema, no cross-references)

Every row MUST have these 22 keys; use `null` (not omitted, not empty string) for unknown values.

## How to identify a tomb headword

Each TT tomb's section begins with a heading line of the form:

```
N. NAME (cartouches), <Role-or-Title>. <Regnal-or-Dynasty>.
<Sub-site>. (Optional bibliographic cross-ref.)
```

The number is followed by **a period (`.`), middle-dot (`·`), bullet (`•`), OR colon (`:`)** — all four are text-layer-noise variants of the same headword separator. The tomb-number digits themselves can be substituted by visually-similar letters when the publisher OCR confuses Arabic numerals with characters: `z` for `2`, `o` for `0`, `I` for `1`, `J5` for `27`-style-ligatures, etc. Disambiguation: a tomb-number is at column-zero, immediately followed by an all-caps NAME token. A spaced rendering like `3 I. K H oN s` at column zero (with mid-token spaces inside both number and name) is still a tomb-number headword; collapse spaces and read as `31. KHONS`. The `===== PHYSICAL PAGE N =====` markers also start at column zero — distinguish by the second token (page-marker → `PHYSICAL`; tomb-row → all-caps NAME).

The headword block ends at the first body sub-header — any of `Court.`, `Court with Chapel.`, `Chapel.`, `Passage.`, `Hall.`, `Burial Chamber.`, `Burial Chambers.`, `Burial Chamber of <X>.`, `Inner Room.`, `Vestibule.`, `Outer Hall.`, `Side-room.`, `Pillar.`, `Shrine.`, `Sarcophagus.`, `Entrance.`, `Stairway to entrance.`, `Façade.`, `Forecourt.`, `Portico.`, `Finds`, or any line introducing scene-by-scene `(1) … (2) …` prose. Lines like `Father, …`, `Mother, …`, `Wife, …`, `Wives, …`, `Wives (of <X>), …`, `Parents, …`, `Plan, p. N`, `Map I, …`, `Map II, …`, `Map IV, …`, `Map V, …`, `Map VI, …`, and the bibliographic-references paragraph (any long run of `<AUTHOR>, <Title>, …` citations between the headword block and the first body sub-header) are part of the headword block but supply structured-field content selectively (see field rules below).

Cartouche garbage: PM prints royal/personal-name cartouches inline; the text layer renders these as `~~~`, `}}`, `c:7`, `0,`, `Q`, `Q Q`, `~`, `[~]`, etc. Drop the cartouche garbage from `occupant_name`. The titlecase English NAME token before the cartouche garbage is the canonical handle.

## Expected TT numbering in PM I.1 § I (TT181–TT190 range)

A pre-extraction headword scan suggests PM I.1 catalogues the TT181–TT190 decade. Expected row count is approximately 10, but verify by reading the chunk: PM I.1 has occasional gaps (TT-numbers without entries) and occasional collapsed entries (multiple tomb numbers sharing a single headword block — some chunks in this range contain floor-plan plate captions listing tomb numbers in the `TOMBS <list>` form — these are plate-caption headers, NOT multi-tomb headword blocks; ignore them for row emission).

If your headword scan returns a number outside this range, RE-CHECK the chunk file — it may be (a) a scene-number marker like `(7)` or `(8)` (not a tomb row), (b) a plate-caption tomb-number reference (PM I.1 prints shared floor-plan captions of the form `TOMBS <list-of-numbers>` mid-section), (c) a cross-reference from one tomb's headword to another (`also owner of tomb N` / `(name in tomb N)`), (d) the TT191 headword at the chunk tail (boundary marker — first TT of the next decade, OUT of scope), or (e) a publisher running-header `Tombs N and N+1` or `Tomb N` page-header. None of those are tomb headwords for THIS chunk.

## PM-I.1 text-layer noise (chunk-27-relevant)

`postprocess.py` runs against this chunk file and normalises the patterns shared with chunks 1–12 (Ḥ-substitutes including `J.I` → `Ḥ`; `<` adjacent to letter → `ʿ`; whitelisted Egyptian-name `c` → `ʿ`; `Ist ed.` → `1st ed.`; king-name-anchored Roman-numeral fixes). The following residual patterns are NOT yet whitelisted in the postprocessor and are handled at prompt + `CHUNK27_CORRECTIONS` level (post-merge in `fix_rows.py`). None of them have unique-bigram signatures stable enough across chunks to safely promote to postprocess (collision risk with non-tomb-headword content is too high — see chunk-10 transcribe.md noise inventory for the precedent).

- **Tomb-number-position digit/letter substitution.** Headword tomb-numbers can render as non-canonical glyph clusters; prior chunks observed `12•` (bullet for period), `zo.` (z for 2 / o for 0), `33·` (middle-dot), `3 I.`-shaped clusters, colon-for-period (`<NUMBER>:`), `s8` (s for 5) for TT58 (chunk-14), and chunk-14 already noted `s` or `S` substituting for `8`. Continuing OCR-substitution combinations are possible — any letter shape that visually resembles a printed digit (the examples from prior chunks above cover the established class; new chunk-specific substitutions may surface). Disambiguate by column-zero position followed by an all-caps NAME token; collapse the noise to the canonical `<NUMBER>.` form for `tomb_id`. **All-caps name following the noise glyph is the discriminator** — a body-prose number-shaped glyph not at column zero or not followed by a NAME-IN-CAPS is NOT a tomb headword.
- **Capital underdot-Ḥ residuals.** PM-I.1 prints capital underdot-Ḥ (`Ḥ`) inside all-caps name tokens; chunk 9 added `J.I` to the postprocess table. Other Ḥ-residuals appear with one-off contextual signatures: `<DIGIT>;I` clusters preceding name-tail (chunk-10 precedent), and `<LETTER>FJ.`-shaped clusters following a vowel inside a CAPS NAME token. Read as `Ḥ` per PM's printed page, then apply the `occupant_name` strip-Ḥ rule below.
- **Capital d-emphatic `Ḏ` (d-bar, U+1E0E) — NOT `Ḍ` (d-underdot, U+1E0C).** PM-I.1 uses the standard Egyptological d-bar (`Ḏ` / `ḏ`) for the d-emphatic in the Thoth/Djehuty (`Ḏḥwty`) name family — including derived names like Ḏḥutmose and Sit-ḏḥout (chunks 12, 8 precedents) and other members of the Ḏḥwty root family. PR #151 (egyptologist printed-source review) verified this on PM I.2 p.604 (`Ḏḥuti`) and p.755 (`Sit-ḏḥout`); PR #200 (chunk-12 TT32 `Ḏhutmosi`) extended the convention to PM I.1. The d-emphatic and d-underdot are DIFFERENT consonants — wrong-consonant risk: a row keyed on `Ḍ` would never match against TLA / Trismegistos / museum data using `Ḏ`. The text-layer OCR signature for capital d-bar inside a CAPS NAME varies by chunk: chunk-10 saw `:[>` (decoded historically as `Ḍ` but per PR #200 audit issue #201 the precedent is now d-bar `Ḏ`); chunk-12 saw `{>l;I` (combined d-bar + Ḥ-residual cluster); chunk-13 TT45 saw `I)` for `Ḏ`. New cluster shapes may continue to surface chunk-to-chunk. When you encounter an unfamiliar non-letter cluster immediately preceding a CAPS NAME-TOKEN whose surviving tail you can identify as the Thoth/Djehuty name family (by Egyptological knowledge of the root), read the cluster as `Ḏ` (d-bar) per the chunk-10/-12/-13 precedent. Then apply the `occupant_name` rules: preserve `Ḏ` (d-bar), strip `Ḥ` (underdot-Ḥ) to plain `H`.
- **Capital underdot-Ḳ.** `I>.` cluster for capital underdot-Ḳ (chunk-9 precedent). Underdot-Ḳ is preserved in `occupant_name`.
- **Token-final ayin `<NAME>(`.** The publisher renders trailing-ayin as `<LETTER>(` adjacent to a cartouche-glyph context (chunk-9 precedent). Preserve ayin in `occupant_name`.
- **Vowel-cluster substitution `ii → ū`.** Double-`i` (`ii`) inside a name token where PM prints a macron-ū. Restore PM's printed macron-vowels in `notes_from_pm` (verbatim-preserve field) and in `occupant_name` (matchable form preserves macrons per the chunk-7 `Wahʿankh` precedent).
- **Capital macron drop in CAPS headwords.** pypdf text-layer drops capital macrons inside all-caps NAME tokens (e.g. `MENTUEMḤĒT` rendered as `MENTUEMHET`, `PEDAMENŌPET` as `PEDAMENOPET`, `PUIMRĒʿ` as `PUIMRE`). The lowercase macrons in body prose ARE preserved. Restore macrons via the post-merge egyptologist printed-source review (CHUNK27_CORRECTIONS in `fix_rows.py`); do NOT pre-derive macrons from outside knowledge at extraction time.
- **Mid-dot/bullet for trailing apostrophe** in sub-site declarations like `Dra' Abû el-Naga'.` rendered as `Dra· Abu el-Naga·.` / `Dra· Abu el-Naga•.`. The canonical sub-site form for `theban_area` is documented per-row below.

## Field-by-field extraction rules

### `tomb_id`

`TT<N>` where `<N>` is the Arabic tomb number from the heading line (10 expected values: TT181–TT190). Apply the tomb-number-position-noise rule above when the OCR has substituted digits/letters. Some tomb-numbers in this range render with a middle-dot separator (`<N>·` instead of `<N>.`); collapse to canonical `<N>.` for `tomb_id`.

### `theban_area`

**Per-row extraction.** Each TT181–TT190 headword's sub-site line — the line immediately below the title clause — declares which sub-site that row belongs to. Read the chunk and assign per row using the canonical forms below.

Canonical sub-site forms (use these literal strings; preserve PM's diacritics and apostrophes per the canonicalisation already established in chunks 7–11):
- **`"Sh. ʿAbd el-Qurna"`** — Sheikh ʿAbd el-Qurna (with U+02BF MODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RING for the ayin in `ʿAbd`; `Sh.` abbreviated as PM prints, period preserved).
- **`"Dra' Abu el-Naga"`** — Dra' Abu el-Naga (ASCII apostrophe after `Dra`, no trailing apostrophe — chunk-7 / chunk-10 / chunk-11 precedent).
- **`"ʿAsâsîf"`** — ʿAsâsîf (leading ayin U+02BF; circumflex `â` and `î` preserved per PM's printed typography).
- **`"Khokha"`** — Khokha (no diacritics; PM prints in plain Roman).
- **`"Qurnet Muraʿi"`** — Qurnet Muraʿi (chunk-12 precedent; ASCII space between `Qurnet` and `Muraʿi`; U+02BF MODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RING for the ayin in `Muraʿi`).

If a row's headword sub-site line declares a sub-site NOT in this list, restore it to its canonical form per PM's printed text and report it in your final report as a new sub-site that may need adding to the canonical list.

### `occupant_name`

**PM-verbatim, conventional-English form, titlecase.** Extract the NAME token from the heading line after applying the README's diacritic policy and the noise rules above.

Per the project's `occupant_name` matchable-name policy:
- Strip underdot-Ḥ (`Ḥ` / `ḥ`) → plain `H` / `h`. Underdot-Ḥ is the ONLY scholarly diacritic stripped from `occupant_name`.
- Preserve ayin (`ʿ`) where PM prints it as a distinguishing radical (chunk-7 / chunk-8 / chunk-9 precedent).
- Preserve underdot-Ḳ (`Ḳ` / `ḳ`) (chunk-7 / chunk-9 precedent).
- Preserve d-bar `Ḏ` / `ḏ` (U+1E0E / U+1E0F) for the Thoth/Djehuty (`Ḏḥwty`) name family — chunk-12 TT32 `Ḏhutmosi` precedent (PR #200) per PR #151 egyptologist-verified printed-source convention. NOT to be confused with d-underdot `Ḍ` (a different consonant). chunk-10 TT11 `Ḍhout` is currently under audit issue #201 for the same correction.
- Preserve vowel macrons (`ū`, `ō`, `ē`, `ā` AND their capital forms `Ū`, `Ō`, `Ē`, `Ā`) where PM prints them in name tokens (chunk-7 `Wahʿankh` precedent). When PM's headword is in all-caps and contains a capital-macron cluster, the macron-preserve rule applies AT TITLECASE — i.e. titlecase the all-caps form, preserve the macron on the resulting lowercase vowel, then apply strip-Ḥ if the title contained `Ḥ`/`ḥ`. The matchable form preserves the macron and strips only underdot-Ḥ.
- Drop cartouche garbage (the text-layer noise after the name token).

Honorific prefixes that PM uses to introduce role (an all-caps `KING`, `PRINCE`, `QUEEN`, `VIZIER` before the name) — strip from `occupant_name`, capture in `occupant_role`. When PM uses an all-caps role prefix before the name, strip it; otherwise the role is given by the title clause AFTER the name (see `occupant_role` rules).

**Null-name (anonymous-occupant) headwords.** When PM's headword does NOT name the original occupant — typical phrasings (per the chunk-8 KV12/KV39/KV56 + QV36/QV40/QV73/QV75 + chunk-14 TT58 precedents) include `A QUEEN, no name`, `A PRINCESS, no name, Dyn. XX`, `Name unknown`, and `<NUMBER>. <NO-NAME-PHRASE>, <subsequent clause>` shapes where no proper-name NAME-IN-CAPS token appears between the tomb-number separator and the title clause — emit `occupant_name=null`. The role flattens to `"Unknown"` per the role rules below; the verbatim phrasing PM uses for the no-name marker goes in `notes_from_pm`. The usurpation rule (above) is structurally independent and applies separately whenever PM uses the `Usurped by` clause regardless of whether the primary occupant is named or anonymous. **An additional anonymous-form variant** that may appear in PM-I.1: a headword whose ENTIRE clause begins `<NUMBER>. Usurped by <USURPER-NAME>, <USURPER-TITLE>` with NO PRIMARY NAME or `Name unknown` marker before `Usurped by` — this is the same anonymous-original-occupant case (the original occupant is anonymous; PM only names the usurper). Same handling: `occupant_name=null`, `occupant_role="Unknown"`, the `Usurped by ...` clause goes in `notes_from_pm` verbatim (the deriver fires `is_usurped=true` post-merge).

**Bracketed-name-fragment headwords.** PM uses square brackets `[X]` for editorially-restored or damaged-text portions of a name. A headword like `<NUMBER>. [ABC?]KHONS ..., <title>` would indicate the first syllable `[ABC?]` is PM's editor's restoration of a partly-damaged name token — the surviving fragment is the un-bracketed tail. Emit `occupant_name` with the bracketed-prefix portion preserved verbatim INCLUDING the brackets and the question mark (PM-faithful policy: do not silently strip editorial brackets — they encode source-data uncertainty). Titlecase the all-caps form, preserve `[?]` markers (so a fabricated example like `[ABC?]KHONS` would render as `[Abc?]khons`), strip underdot-Ḥ if present. The bracketed reading goes in `occupant_name` for matchability; the verbatim editorial bracketing in `notes_from_pm` is OPTIONAL (only if PM repeats the headword in body prose with the same brackets).

### `occupant_alt_names`

Alternate name forms PM gives for the SAME PERSON in the headword block. PM's `<NAME-A>, also called <NAME-B>` phrasing is the canonical pattern (e.g. chunk-7 DAN- prefixed alt-name surfaces). When PM prints this in a chunk-27 headword, capture the secondary name token in `occupant_alt_names`. Apply the same diacritic/noise rules as `occupant_name`. Empty list `[]` when absent.

`L. D. Text, No. N` / `CHAMPOLLION, No. N` / `WILKINSON MSS. v. N` cross-refs are NOT alt-names — those go in `notes_from_pm` per the cross-numbering parenthetical rule.

### `tomb_aliases`

Popular names of the tomb itself (19th-c. surveyor designations, classical aliases, local Arabic names). Empty list `[]` when absent.

### `co_occupants` and `is_joint_burial`

Both fields apply ONLY when PM's headword names more than one person buried in the tomb. Apply the structural rule mechanically per headword.

- `<NAME-A> … and son <NAME-B>` (or `…and daughter <NAME-B>`, etc.) — **hierarchical** (NAME-A is the parent, syntactic head). NAME-B goes in `co_occupants` with per-person role; `is_joint_burial = false`.
- `<NAME-A> … and <NAME-B>, <PLURAL-ROLE>` — **coordinate** (no syntactic primacy; PM lists them as a coordinate pair, the plural role applies to both). `is_joint_burial = true`. NAME-B goes in `co_occupants` with the same role as NAME-A.
- Single-occupant headword (no `and <NAME-B>`): `co_occupants: []`, `is_joint_burial: false`.

The role assigned to each `co_occupants[]` entry follows the same controlled-vocabulary mapping as `occupant_role` (see below). Per-person `alt_names: []` is the common case; populate only if PM gives a parenthesised alternative form for that specific person.

**Family clauses on the lines below the title** (`Father, …`, `Mother, …`, `Wife, …`, `Wives (of <X>), …`, `Parents, …`) name family members who are NOT buried in the tomb — they go in `notes_from_pm`, NOT in `co_occupants`.

**Usurpation pattern** (chunk-12 precedent). PM's `Partly usurped by <USURPER-NAME>, <USURPER-ROLE>` clause in a headword (e.g. `<NAME-A>, <ROLE>. Partly usurped by <NAME-B>, <USURPER-ROLE>. <Regnal>.`) describes a tomb where a later occupant re-used the original burial. The original occupant (NAME-A) is the headword name and stays in `occupant_name`. The usurper does NOT go in `co_occupants` — usurpation is structurally distinct from co-burial; PM's prose marker is the differentiator. The usurper's name + role is preserved verbatim in `notes_from_pm`. The Tier-3 deriver fires `is_usurped=true` automatically from the regex match on `usurp(?:ed|ation)` in `notes_from_pm` — emit the field default `false` at extraction time and let the deriver overwrite post-merge.

### `occupant_role`

Controlled vocabulary: `"King"`, `"Queen"`, `"Royal Family"`, `"Vizier"`, `"Official"`, `"High Priest"`, `"Princess"`, `"Prince"`, `"Unknown"`.

Assignment rules:
1. If `occupant_name` is null (cartouche-blank / uninscribed): role `"Unknown"`.
2. If the headword title clause names a controlled-vocab role explicitly (e.g. `Vizier`, `Princess`, `King`, `High Priest of <X>`, `First prophet of <X>` flattens to `"High Priest"` only when the deity is a major cult-deity like Amun/Amen-Re — for minor cults flatten to `"Official"`): use the controlled-vocab match.
3. Otherwise the controlled-vocab assignment for non-royal occupational titles (workman / scribe / chiseller / foreman / priest / official / steward / overseer / royal butler / royal scribe / fan-bearer / chief steward / brazier-bearer) flattens to **`"Official"`**.
4. **`Vizier` precedence.** When the title clause names BOTH a non-Vizier functional title AND `Vizier` (e.g. `<functional-title>, Vizier`), apply rule 2 with the Vizier match — `Vizier` is in the controlled vocab and PM's listing places it as the structurally-determining role. The verbatim full title clause (including the non-Vizier portion) goes in `notes_from_pm`.
5. **`King's son` + functional title.** PM's `<NAME>, King's son, <secondary-title>` describes a royal-blood individual whose primary functional role per PM is the secondary title. Apply rule 2 only when the secondary title is in the controlled vocab; otherwise fall through to rule 3 (`"Official"` flatten) and preserve `King's son` verbatim in `notes_from_pm`. The controlled-vocab role names structural placement, not noble blood.

The verbatim role-title clause that PM prints in the headword title-clause goes in `notes_from_pm` regardless of which controlled-vocab role applies — read it from the chunk and preserve as PM prints.

### `dynasty`, `sub_period`, `date_bce_approx_start`, `date_bce_approx_end`

**All `null`** for every row at this extraction stage. Phase A enrichment fills these from the king authority. Do NOT supply from outside knowledge or from PM's `Temp. <King>` / `Dyn. <Numeral>` / `Saite.` / `Ramesside.` clauses — those go in `notes_from_pm` verbatim.

### `location_sub_area`

`null` unless PM's headword explicitly declares a finer-grained sub-area inside its sub-site (e.g. `Eastern Cemetery.` flag) — `theban_area` already captures the coarse sub-site. If a headword in this range declares a finer-grained sub-area, populate `location_sub_area` and report it.

### `discovery_year`, `discoverer`

`null` for every row. `Excavated by <X>` / `Discovered by <X>` / `<Author>, <Title>, <Date>` clauses go in `notes_from_pm` only when they're part of the headword's structured prose.

### `is_unfinished`

`true` iff the literal word `Unfinished` (capital-U) appears in the headword block of a TT tomb. Otherwise `false`. Apply mechanically per headword.

### `shared_with_tombs`

List of tomb-id strings parsed from cross-tomb references in the headword block. PM I.1 phrasings to capture:
- `See also Tomb N` / `See also Tombs N and M` (chunk-9 precedent).
- `Also owner of tomb N` / `(Also owner of tomb N.)` / `(Perhaps also owner of tomb N.)` / `(also owner of tombs N and M)` (chunk-9 precedent).

**Cross-valley references (chunk-12 precedent).** PM may print a cross-tomb-ownership reference that names the OTHER VALLEY explicitly: `(Also owner of tomb N in the Valley of the Kings.)`. The `Valley of the Kings` qualifier indicates the cross-referenced number is a `KV<N>` not a `TT<N>`. Populate `shared_with_tombs` with the prefix-qualified string (`"KV<N>"`, NOT `"TT<N>"`). The field is `list[str]`; semantically, cross-valley ownership is the same structural relation as same-valley ownership and the prefix-tagged string is the matchable form. If PM does NOT name a valley qualifier, default to `TT<N>` (chunks 1–10 convention). Hedged variants (`Perhaps also owner of …`) DO populate `shared_with_tombs` regardless of the hedge.

Empty list `[]` when absent.

Numbered tomb cross-refs only — do not list `(belonging to (4))`, `(tomb 7)` mid-prose scene cross-refs, or footnote-misnumbering corrections like `[For WRESZ., Atlas, … called by him tomb N, … see tomb M]`. Those are scene-internal references / Wreszinski misnumberings, not headword cross-refs.

### `notes_from_pm`

A short verbatim prose fragment from the headword block that doesn't fit a structured field. **Verbatim-preserve against PM's printed text** — preserve PM's diacritics including `ḥ`, `ʿ`, `ḳ`, `ḍ`, `ē`, `ō`, `ū`, `â`, `î` where the printed page carries them (do NOT apply the strip-ḥ rule here; that rule is for `occupant_name` only). Capture each of the following clause types from the headword as PM prints them, joined by `". "`:

- **Verbatim role-title clause** (the title description that follows the name) — preserve PM's exact wording. For Vizier rows, include the full functional title clause as PM prints it (e.g. `"<functional-title>, Vizier."`).
- **Regnal / dynasty clauses** (`Dyn. <Numeral>.`, `<Period>.`, `Temp. <King>.`, `Temp. <King-A> to <King-B>.`, `Saite.`, `Ramesside.`). Preserve PM's wording verbatim.
- **Family clauses on the lines below the title** (`Father, <Name>`, `Mother, <Name>`, `Wife, <Name>`, `Wives, <Name> and <Name>`, `Wives, <Name-A> and <Name-B> or <Name-C>` (the `or` form indicates `<Name-C>` is an alternate-name reading of `<Name-B>`, NOT a third wife — preserve PM's `or` verbatim and treat the wife list as 2 distinct people), `Wives, <Name>, <Name> (name in tomb), and <Name> (names from cones)` (multi-wife with object-cite parentheticals identifying which wife is attested where — preserve verbatim including the per-wife object-cite parentheticals), `Wives (of <X>), <Name>; (of <Y>), <Name>` (whose-wife disambiguation pattern from chunks 9–10), `Parents, <Name>, <Title>, and <Name>`). These name family members who are NOT buried in the tomb. Use the convention `Wife, <Name>.` (singular) or `Wives, <Name> and <Name>.` (plural). When PM disambiguates whose-wife with a parenthetical, preserve the parenthetical.
- **Object-cite parentheticals** (`(name from offering-table of <Person>, in <Museum> <Cat-No.>)`). Preserve where PM prints them — these are catalog cross-references the schema retains.
- **Cross-numbering parentheticals** (`(L. D. Text, No. <N>.)`, `(CHAMPOLLION, No. <N>.)`, `(HAY, No. <N>.)`). Preserve where PM prints them as headword cross-numbering.
- **Usurpation clauses** (chunk-12 precedent): `Partly usurped by <USURPER-NAME>, <USURPER-ROLE>` — preserve verbatim. The Tier-3 `is_usurped` deriver fires on the `usurp` regex match.
- **Tomb-state-marker parentheticals on the sub-site line** (chunk-12 precedent): a parenthesised state-marker following the sub-site declaration (shapes like `(<state-marker>.)`) — preserve verbatim. There is no `is_inaccessible` / `is_unexcavated` schema field; the prose stays in `notes_from_pm`.
- **Hedge tokens for PRIMARY attribution** (`(probably)`, `(?)`) when printed against the occupant's NAME or identification — preserve verbatim. These feed the Tier-3 `attribution_certainty` derivation (regex fires `"uncertain"` on `(?)`, `"probable"` on `(probably)` / `Probably`). **Note:** PM's `Temp. <King> (?)` qualifies the regnal date, NOT the occupant identification; per chunk-9 TT2 + chunk-10 TT12/TT17/TT19/TT20 precedent, those rows get `DERIVER_OVERRIDES` post-merge to pin `attribution_certainty="attested"`. Emit defaults at extraction time and let the post-merge override layer handle the regnal-vs-occupant distinction.

Drop entirely from `notes_from_pm`:
- `Plan, p. N`, `Map I, …`, `Map IV, …`, `Map V, …`, `Map VI, …` plan-marker references.
- The bibliographic-references paragraph (any long run of `<AUTHOR>, <Title>, …` citations between the headword block and the first body sub-header).
- **The cross-tomb-ownership parentheticals** `(Also owner of tomb N.)`, `(Perhaps also owner of tomb N.)`, `(Also owner of tomb N in the Valley of the Kings.)`, `(also owner of tombs N and M)` — these are structurally captured by `shared_with_tombs` (numbered cross-refs there). Do NOT also place them in `notes_from_pm`; the `Perhaps` hedge in the secondary-attribution clause would otherwise spuriously trigger the Tier-3 `attribution_certainty="uncertain"` deriver on a row whose PRIMARY attribution is fully attested.

`null` when the headword has nothing beyond the bare name + cartouche garbage + sub-site (rare for chunk-27 — PM I.1 headwords are dense and most rows carry substantial structured content).

### `source_citation`

Object with three fixed keys:

- `"edition"`: exactly `"PM I.1 2nd ed. 1960"`.
- `"section"`: exactly `"I"` (PM I.1's "I. NUMBERED TOMBS" master section — no sub-section letter for this range).
- `"page"`: the **printed** page number on which the tomb's headword line sits. Extract from the chunk file's `===== PHYSICAL PAGE N (PRINTED PAGE M) =====` markers. Use `M` (the printed number), NOT `N` (the physical number). Do NOT supply from memory.

### Tier-3 typed flags (`is_uninscribed`, `is_usurped`, `attribution_certainty`)

These three fields are **emit defaults at extraction time** — `false`, `false`, `"attested"`. The `fix_rows.py` `_apply_issue_182_migrations` deriver runs post-merge and overwrites them deterministically from regex matches against `notes_from_pm`. Do NOT pre-derive them in your output; emit the defaults so the deriver's run produces a clean idempotent log entry.

Background (FYI only): the deriver flips `is_uninscribed=true` on `\buninscribed\b`, `is_usurped=true` on `\busurp(?:ed|ation)\b`, and sets `attribution_certainty` to `"uncertain"` on `\b(uncertain|perhaps|possibly|tentatively)\b|\(\?\)`, `"probable"` on `\bprobably\b|\(probably\)|\battributed to\b`. Primary-attribution hedges that ARE captured in `notes_from_pm` per the rules above DO fire the regex; secondary-clause hedges (like the `Temp. <King> (?)` regnal-date hedge in chunk-10 TT12/TT17/TT19/TT20, or the chunk-9 TT2 secondary-wife `(probably)` hedge) need post-merge `DERIVER_OVERRIDES` entries to revert to `"attested"`.

## Structural gotchas to watch

- **Scene numbers vs tomb headwords.** Long body-prose blocks `(1) … (2) … (3) … (10) …` with parenthesised numbers are scene-item markers, NOT tomb headwords. Distinguish by line-start position: tomb headwords start at column zero with `<digit><separator> <NAME-IN-CAPS>`; scene markers are inset and start `(N)`.
- **Plate-caption headers.** PM I.1 prints `TOMBS <list-of-numbers>` plate captions for shared floor plans (e.g. captions referencing tombs 36–43 may appear within this chunk's range). NOT tomb headwords for the listed numbers; distinguish by the line being a stand-alone plate caption (no scene-number list, no body prose around it) rather than a tomb headword starting with `<NUMBER>. <NAME>`.
- **Page-running-headers.** Lines like `Tombs 21 and 22`, `Tomb 23`, `Tombs 23 and 24`, `Tombs 27, 28, and 29`, `Tombs 30 and 31`, `Tombs 31 and 32` (publisher running-header at the top of each printed page) are running-headers, NOT tomb headwords.
- **Name collisions across decades.** Two distinct individuals can share a NAME token in their headword across different TT rows — same name, different person, different role, sub-site, regnal period. Chunk 10's TT17 surfaced one such case. The schema row-key is `tomb_id`, not name; treat each row's headword independently for role / regnal / sub-site / notes fields. Do NOT collapse two rows with the same NAME into one — emit distinct rows with their distinct field content.
- **Boundary marker — TT191.** The chunk file extends through physical p.316 so you can see the boundary clearly. **Do not extract any TT191+ rows (TT191 is the first row of the next decade; stop at TT190).** Stop at the end of TT190's headword block. (TT181 IS in scope and IS the first row to extract.)
- **Page boundary internal to a tomb.** Some headwords span a printed-page break (the headword starts on page N and the body continues on page N+1). The headword's PRINTED page is the page where its first headword line sits — extract from the page marker that immediately precedes the headword line, not from a body-prose page.

## Pitfall summary (read LAST before running)

1. **approximately 10 rows expected** — verify by reading the chunk; PM I.1 has occasional gaps in other decades. If you find fewer than 10 headwords, re-check for anonymous/untitled entries before concluding a gap exists.
2. **PM I.1 offset is +18** (printed = physical − 18). Use the `===== PRINTED PAGE M =====` marker for `source_citation.page`.
3. **`section: "I"`**, **`edition: "PM I.1 2nd ed. 1960"`**.
4. **`theban_area` is per-row.** Use the canonical sub-site list above; ASCII apostrophe in `Dra' Abu el-Naga`, U+02BF ayin in `ʿAsâsîf` / `Sh. ʿAbd el-Qurna` / `Qurnet Muraʿi`, circumflex preserved in `ʿAsâsîf`. Read each headword's sub-site line and assign per row.
5. **`is_joint_burial`** / **`co_occupants`**: apply the hierarchical (`X and son Y`, `false`) vs coordinate (`X and Y, plural-role`, `true`) rule mechanically per headword. Single-occupant: `is_joint_burial=false`, `co_occupants=[]`. **Usurpers do NOT go in `co_occupants`** — usurpation prose stays in `notes_from_pm`; the deriver flips `is_usurped=true`.
6. **`shared_with_tombs`**: populate when a TT181–TT190 headword carries `Also owner of tomb N` / `Perhaps also owner of tomb N` / `See also Tomb N` / `(also owner of tombs N and M)` / `(Also owner of tomb N in the Valley of the Kings.)` phrasing. Use `KV<N>` for cross-valley references when PM names the valley qualifier; default to `TT<N>` otherwise.
7. **`occupant_role`** per the controlled-vocab rules; non-royal occupational titles flatten to `"Official"` UNLESS PM explicitly names a controlled-vocab role. The verbatim role-title clause goes in `notes_from_pm` regardless.
8. **`dynasty` / `sub_period` / `date_bce_*` / `location_sub_area` / `discovery_year` / `discoverer`** all `null` for every row — Phase A enrichment fills these. PM's `Temp. <King>` / `Dyn.` / `Saite.` / `Ramesside.` clauses go verbatim into `notes_from_pm`, not into typed fields.
9. **PM-I.1 noise residuals**: chunk-9/10 classes (`12•` / `zo.` / `33·` for tomb-number variants; `J.I` / `<DIGIT>;I` for `Ḥ`-residuals; `:[>` and `{>l;I` for capital d-emphatic — read as `Ḏ` (d-bar) per PR #200 + #151 precedent, NOT as `Ḍ`; `I>.` for `Ḳ`; `<LETTER>(` for token-final ayin); plus chunk-11 additions (colon-for-period `<NUMBER>:` in tomb-number position; `<LETTER>FJ.`-shaped clusters following a vowel inside CAPS NAME for `Ḥ`-residual; double-`i` for macron-`ū` inside name tokens; capital macron drops in CAPS headwords like `MENTUEMHET` for `MENTUEMḤĒT`).
10. **Tier-3 typed flags** emit defaults (`false`/`false`/`"attested"`); the `fix_rows.py` deriver overwrites post-merge.
11. **Preserve d-bar `Ḏ` / `ḏ` and underdot-Ḳ (`Ḳ` / `ḳ`)** in `occupant_name`; only underdot-Ḥ is stripped. The d-emphatic in the Thoth/Djehuty (`Ḏḥwty`) name family is the standard Egyptological d-bar `Ḏ` (U+1E0E), NOT d-underdot `Ḍ` (U+1E0C, a different consonant).
12. **Preserve vowel macrons** (`ū`, `ō`, `ē`, `ā` AND capital forms `Ū`, `Ō`, `Ē`, `Ā` in all-caps headwords — titlecase the name then preserve the macron on the resulting lowercase vowel) and circumflexes (`â`, `î`) in `occupant_name` AND `notes_from_pm` per PM's printed page.
13. **Multi-wife pattern variants** (chunk-12 precedent): `Wives, <Name-A> and <Name-B> or <Name-C>` (the `or` indicates `<Name-C>` is an alternate-name reading of `<Name-B>`, NOT a third wife — preserve verbatim including the `or`); `Wives, <Name>, <Name> (name in tomb), and <Name> (names from cones)` (multi-wife with object-cite per-wife parentheticals identifying which wife is attested where — preserve verbatim with all parentheticals). All multi-wife clauses go in `notes_from_pm` per the family-clause rule, NOT in `co_occupants` (wives are not buried in the tomb).

## Report back

After writing the JSONL, output a one-paragraph report with:
- Row count (approximately 10 expected) and the complete list of TT tomb_ids you emitted in sort order.
- Per-row `theban_area` assignments (read each headword's sub-site line; map to the canonical sub-site list above).
- Any field you're uncertain about, with the field name and your best-guess value.
- Any unexpected text-layer noise that this prompt doesn't already flag.
- For any structured-field anomalies (usurpation, co-occupancy, cross-valley ownership, controlled-vocab roles other than Official, anonymous-occupant headwords, etc.) you identified in the chunk, note which PM phrasing triggered the classification.
